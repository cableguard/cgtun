# CableGuard TUN

**CableGuard TUN** is an implementation of the [WireGuard<sup>Â®</sup>](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol with Rich Online Digital Tokens (RODiT). RODiT are an implementation of non-fungible tokens that contain all the configuration, identity, and subscription information for Cableguard TUN endpoints. Cableguard TUN is based on Cloudflare's Borintung, a Rust implememtation of Wireguard. 
This project is part of a large ecosystem (Cableguard FORGE, Cableguard TOOL, Cableguard WALLET, Cableguard FIND and Cableguard AUTH), and consists of three parts:

* The executable `cableguard-cli`, a [userspace WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/) implementation for Linux and macOS.
* The library `cableguard` that implements the underlying WireGuard protocol, without the network or tunnel stacks that need to be that need to be implemented in a platform idiomatic way.
* The rodtwallet.sh scripts (temporary implementation of Cableguard WALLET) that works with the NEAR CLI interface. It provides barebones command line crytographic commands for the management of RODiT and NEAR implicit accounts.

## How to Install from Source
- sudo apt install pkg-config
- git clone https://github.com/alanesmizi/cableguardvpn.git
- cargo build --bin cableguard-cli --release
By default the executable is placed in the `./target/release` folder. You can copy it to a desired location manually, or install it using `cargo install --bin cableguard --path .`.

You may want to add to .bashrc these lines:
- sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi ./<path>/cableguard-cli
- export BLOCKCHAIN_ENV=testnet (for testnet, mainnet for mainnet)

## How to Install from .deb package
wget https://drive.google.com/file/d/17FCSKV3C3CGW7wG_eZ3y_qPUHbLo8cov/view?usp=drive_link
sudo apt install ./cableguard-cli_0.90.11_amd64.deb

## How to Use
To start a tunnel use:
`cableguard-cli [-f/--foreground] <filewithaccount.json>`

Where <filewithaccount.json> is a NEAR implicit account created with ./wallet/rodtwallet.sh genaccount

`cableguard` will drop privileges when started. When privileges are dropped it is not possible to set `fwmark`. If `fwmark` is required, such as when using `wg-quick`, run with `--disable-drop-privileges` or set the environment variable `WG_SUDO=1`.
You will need to give the executable the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability using: `sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi cableguard`.

It may be possible to use with [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg-quick.8) by setting the environment variable `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` to `cableguard`. For example:
`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=cableguard-cli WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`

## Supported platforms
- It has only been tested in AMD/Intel
- `x86-64` architecture is supported.

# Cableguard Ecosystem
- Cableguard TUN: VPN tunnels
- Cableguard TOOLS: local VPN tunnel configuration
- Cableguard FORGE: RODiT minter
- Cableguard WALLET: RODiT manager
- Cableguard AUTH: RODiT authentication for interoperability with implementation of the Triangle of Trust.
- Cableguard FIND: Server and peer finder
